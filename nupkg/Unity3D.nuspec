    <releaseNotes>
      - Removed unnecessary UNITY_ASSERTIONS define
      - Added the missing UnityModulesPath property (*facepalm*)
      - Added short-hand properties for more locations, including assemblies within a Unity project folder
      - The test solution is now more flexible, containing fewer projects that can each be built with a different target framework and version of Unity
      - Added some test Unity scenes in various Unity versions, for testing builds that reference Library/ or Asset Store assemblies
      - Added several improvements to the main README
        - Usage section is now better organized into sub-sections
        - Added instructions to remove the default UnityEngine.dll reference
        - Added instructions to reference assemblies making up Packages, Asset Store assets, and Unity modules
